            Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a game with a similar goal to the regular game. 
            To win, a player must conquer three of the sub boards to make a row column or diagnol. 
            The sub boards themselves must be won by traditional tic tac toe rules.   
            </div>
            <div class = basic_text>
            Players must play on the board corresponding to the last players move on the sub board 
            i.e. if player X played on the top left square of any board, player O must play on the top left board. 
            If a player is sent to a board that is already controlled, they may play on any available board.
