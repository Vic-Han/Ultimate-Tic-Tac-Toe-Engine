            Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a game with a similar goal to the regular game. 
            To win, a player must conquer three of the sub boards to make a row column or diagnol. 
            The sub boards themselves must be won by traditional tic tac toe rules.   
            </div>
            <div class = basic_text>
            Players must play on the board corresponding to the last players move on the sub board 
            i.e. if player X played on the top left square of any board, player O must play on the top left board. 
            If a player is sent to a board that is already controlled, they may play on any available board.

                A weak upper bound for the number of possible games is 81 factorial, 
                as that would include every combination of filling in every square in every order. 
                This is much less complex than chess, but it is still not possible to brute force.

                We can't search indefinitely like we can in the simple counterpart. 
                Traditional chess engines use a heuristic to estimate the rough value of a position, 
                but developing an accurate heuristic for Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is not easy.

                Monte Carlo Tree Search uses random sampling instead of a heuristic. 
                It simulates X amount of random games from that state. 
                If the player wins more than they lose, we can assume that the state is good for that player. 
                With enough simualations we should theoritically approach an object value.
